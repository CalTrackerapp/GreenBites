# Post-Demo Work - December 13, 2025

## Learning
- Production deployment best practices
- Environment variable management for serverless platforms
- Database connection optimization for serverless environments
- Production error handling and debugging strategies

## Challenges
- Resolving database connection issues in production environment
- Configuring environment variables correctly in Vercel
- Debugging production-specific errors that don't occur in localhost
- Optimizing database connection pooling for serverless architecture

## Victories
- Successfully deployed GreenBites to production on Vercel
- Fixed critical database connection issues for production deployment
- Resolved security vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-66478) by updating dependencies
- Improved error handling with detailed error messages for better debugging
- Created comprehensive deployment documentation (VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md)
- Optimized database connection pooling for serverless environments

## Additional Notes
- Application is now live and fully functional in production
- All core features are working: authentication, food logging, dashboards, profile management
- Database connected to Supabase in production environment
- Ready for user testing and feedback
