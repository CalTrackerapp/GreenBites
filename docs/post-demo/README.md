# Post-Demo Work

This folder contains documentation for work completed after the program demo presentation.

## Naming Convention

Files in this folder should follow this naming pattern:
- `post-demo-MM-DD-YYYY.md` - For dated entries (e.g., `post-demo-12-13-2025.md`)
- `post-demo-feature-name.md` - For feature-specific work (e.g., `post-demo-deployment-fixes.md`)

## Structure

Each entry should follow a similar structure to the weekly reflections:

```markdown
# Post-Demo Work - [Date or Feature Name]

## Learning
- What you learned

## Challenges
- Challenges faced

## Victories
- Achievements and completed work

## Additional Notes
- Any other relevant information
```

## Purpose

This folder allows you to continue tracking your progress and improvements to GreenBites after the program completion, maintaining a record of ongoing development and enhancements.
